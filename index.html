    <p>Once upon a time, there was a clever crow who lived in a big forest. The crow used to find solutions to all his problems by using his cleverness. On a hot, sunny day, the crow felt thirsty and wanted to drink some water. So, he flew over the forest, in search of a small pond or a lake to drink water. It was the season of summer so all the lakes were dry and he could not find water to drink anywhere.He refused to give up. He kept searching for water around the forest when he suddenly saw one shiny object on the ground. Keen by nature, the crow flew closer to the ground and to his surprise he saw that it was a water pot. The crow beamed with happiness and thought, “My efforts have paid off! I finally found some water.” As he landed to drink the water out of the pot, he was disappointed because the pot’s neck was too narrow. The crow tried tilting the pot to spill some water out of it but he could not do it because the pot was too heavy. He felt tired and frustrated. Then, he took a moment and thought to himself, “What can I do to take the water out of this pot?</p>
